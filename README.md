# comsldpsy

This repository contains a reproducible research compendium for our
paper:

> Visser, L., Kalmar, J., Görgen, R., Linkersdörfer, J., Rothe, J.,
> Hasselhorn, M., & Schulte-Körne, G. (submitted). *Comorbidities
> between specific learning disorders and psychopathology: a study with
> elementary school children in
Germany*.

### How to cite

Please cite this compendium as:

> Visser, L., Kalmar, J., Görgen, R., Linkersdörfer, J., Rothe, J.,
> Hasselhorn, M., & Schulte-Körne, G., (2018). *Compendium of R code and
> data for ‘Comorbidities between specific learning disorders and

### Contents

The compendium contains all data, code, and text associated with the
paper. It is organized as follows:

  - The `R/` directory contains all the R code.
  - The `inst/analysis_dir/analysis/` directory contains 3 subfolders
    with the following contents
      - `data/`: the raw data
      - `templates/`: the Microsoft word template used to prepare the
        manuscript
      - `manuscript/`: the manuscript as submitted

### How to download or install

There are several ways to use the compendium’s contents and reproduce
the analysis:

  - *Download the compendium as a zip archive* from from this [GitHub
    repository](https://github.com/idea-labs/comsldpsy/archive/master.zip)
    or a registered/frozen version from the associated [OSF
    project](https://osf.io/9mxp2/files).

  - *Install the compendium as an R package* from GitHub using the
    [`devtools`
    package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/devtools/index.html):
    
        install.packages("devtools")
        devtools::install_github("idea-labs/comsldpsy")
    
      - This will install the R package locally including all its
        dependencies.
      - The package includes functions to
          - check the analysis for consistency
          - inspect the analysis pipeline and intermediate results
          - reproduce the analysis results on the user’s computer
      - For more details on how to use the package and its functions,
        see
        [here](https://idea-labs.github.io/comsldpsy/articles/comsldpsy.html).

  - *Reproduce the analysis locally inside a
    [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) container*. This allows to
    replicate the exact computational environment used by the authors.
    The compendium includes a Dockerfile that specifies how to build a
    Docker image that contains all the software dependencies needed to
    run the code and also includes the compendium’s R package, ready to
    use. After [installing
    Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/#supported-platforms), one
    can simply download the image and run the container using:
    
        docker run -p 8888:8888 idealabsffm/comsldpsy
    
      - This command will print a URL to the terminal.
      - Copy this URL and paste it into a web browser.
      - This will open a Jupyter Notebook.
      - Start an interactive RStudio session in the browser by
        selecting:

  - *Reproduce the analysis in the cloud* without having to install any
    software. The same Docker container replicating the computational
    environment used by the authors can be run using BinderHub on
    [mybinder.org](https://mybinder.org/):
    
      - Click
        [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/idea-labs/comsldpsy/master?urlpath=rstudio)
        to launch an interactive RStudio session in your web browser.
